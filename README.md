# Multi-Platform Task Management App with Flutter & BLoC

Welcome to my multi-platform task management application, crafted with Flutter and powered by the robust BLoC state management pattern. This application is designed to shine across iOS, Android, macOS, Windows, and Web, showcasing my ability to create scalable and maintainable code that functions seamlessly on any platform.

## Features

### Unified Codebase: A single codebase that brings a cohesive user experience to all platforms, leveraging Flutter's versatile UI toolkit.
### State Management: Utilizing Flutter BLoC for predictable state management, ensuring a responsive and user-friendly interface.
### Navigation: Go_router for intuitive and named routing, facilitating a smooth and clear navigation structure.
### Animations: animate_do for fluid and eye-catching animations that enhance the user interaction.
### Persistence: hydrated_bloc combined with path_provider to maintain state across sessions with local storage.
### Unique Identifiers: uuid for generating unique task IDs, ensuring data integrity.
### Interactive Charts: fl_chart to visualize tasks and productivity trends, providing insights at a glance.
### Attractive UI: card_swiper for an engaging way to browse tasks, making task management not just productive but also enjoyable.


## Architecture

This repository is structured for clarity and scalability:

### Model-View-BLoC (MV-BLoC): A variant of the MVVM pattern, tailored for Flutter and its reactive framework.
### Organized Directory Structure: Clear separation of concerns with categorized directories for models, blocs, pages, and widgets.
### Code Reusability: Modularized components and shared resources for efficient development practices.

This application is not just a demonstration of Flutter's capabilities but also a testament to my commitment to clean code practices and attention to detail. Dive into the source code to explore how advanced Flutter features are implemented in a real-world project.
